Hello World!			{#hello-world}
====================================

Hello World (again)!


Postscript				{#postcript}
====================================

Actually it is not my first time to own and write a blog. I used to have one based on GitHub & Hexo. My friend Jun lured me to do so in the university. Everything went smoothly except I stopped posting after the first three articles: *Hello World*, *Hello Hexo* and *About CHEN Jian*. The url is [My old blog](iamchenjian.github.io). There was no reason. I just stopped.

Recently I had the same impulsion of having a blog. Since I had a new laptop (Yeah!!!) and a new github account, everything should be redone. For some unknown reasons, I cannot install Hexo any more. I also tried Jekyll (installed locally), failed at connecting my local Jekyll contents to the repo in my github.

Then, I realized I do not need to do so. Since my github was working and I had a repo called iamjianchen.github.repo, I could just clone the repo to my laptop, modify what is necessary, and push it back to github, and every one could have access to my blog [My recent blog](iamjianchen.github.io). And done! I can never understand why the methods was so complicated and messy.

Why not keep it simple and functional ;)

And here comes this blog!
